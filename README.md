# Blog - KodeKash.com

`2Blog || !2Blog` - that is the question. 

## Hey there 👋

This is the repo for my [blog](https://www.kodekash.com) where I share posts about cool things I’ve found or learned. I made the decision to make the repo public to show off how simple a blog created with [Hugo](https://img.shields.io/badge/-hugo-FF4088?logo=hugo&logoColor=white&style=for-the-badge) can be!

To create one for yourself you can read through the easy to follow [quick start guide](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/). 

P.S. - Read [this](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/common-configurations/hugo/) if you want your site to go live 💡
